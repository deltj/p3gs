# Phantom 3 Ground Station (p3gs)
This is my attempt to create a pc-based ground station program for the DJI Phantom 3 quadcopter.

## Objectives
- Display video from the Phantom 3
- Display aircraft position and attitude information
- Display battery status 

Control of the aircraft from software would be nice, but I'm not going to worry about that until I have the initial objectives above working.
